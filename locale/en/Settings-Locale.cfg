[mod-setting-description]
max-spidertron-tier=If set to 5 for example, there will be 5 spidertron tiers, each stronger than the last.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you raise this value, you should lower the values of how the Spidertron scales, as giant spidertrons have some issues (such as not being able to select them with remotes).
spidertron-tier-health-factor=Each spidertron tier has (previous-tier-HP * Health Factor) health.
spidertron-tier-health-addition=Each spidertron tier has (previous-tier-HP + Health Addition) health.
spidertron-tier-inventory-addition=Each spidertron tier has (previous-tier-inventory-size + Inventory Addition) inventory size.
spidertron-tier-grid-width-addition=Each spidertron tier has (previous-tier-grid-width + Grid Width Addition) equipment grid size.
spidertron-tier-grid-height-addition=Each spidertron tier has (previous-tier-grid-height + Grid Height Addition) equipment grid size.
spidertron-tier-weapon-range-addition=Each spidertron tier has (previous-tier-weapon-range + Weapon Range Addition) range on its rocket launchers.
spidertron-tier-weapon-firing-speed-factor=Each spidertron tier has (previous-tier-weapon-firing-speed * Weapon Firing Speed Factor) firing speed.  Lower is faster.
spidertron-tier-one-scale=The tier 1 Spidertron's size will be multiplied by this value.  Particularly useful for making low tier spidertrons small if you have many tiers and don't want the final tier to be too big.\n\nIMPORTANT: Giant spidertrons do not currently work properly, they have no hitbox and cannot be selected by spidertron remotes.  Try to keep your biggest spidertron under 1.8 scale.
spidertron-tier-scale-factor=The size for each spidertron tier will be (previous-spidertron-size * Size Factor).\n\nIMPORTANT: Giant spidertrons do not currently work properly, they have no hitbox and cannot be selected by spidertron remotes.  Try to keep your biggest spidertron under 1.8 scale.\n\nIMPORTANT: Giant spidertrons do not currently work properly, they have no hitbox and cannot be selected by spidertron remotes.  Try to keep your biggest spidertron under 1.8 scale.
spidertron-tier-scale-addition=The size for each spidertron tier will be (previous-spidertron-size + Size Addition).  The unit is in Spidertron Tier 1 size, so for example 0.5 means Spidertron Tier 2 is 1.5x (1.0+0.5) the size of the vanilla spidertron.\n\nIMPORTANT: Giant spidertrons do not currently work properly, they have no hitbox and cannot be selected by spidertron remotes.  Try to keep your biggest spidertron under 1.8 scale.
spidertron-tier-crafting-fusion-cost=Crafting a Spidertron requires combining this many previous-tier Spidertrons.
spidertron-tier-mk2-research-cost=Tier 2 Spidertron will require this many science packs to research.  ALL science packs will be required.  However, if set to zero, the cost will be calculated using the Research Cost Factor and Research Cost Addition instead, using the same science packs as the Tier 1 Spidertron.  For vanilla this means no white science packs required.  For mods that use more science packs, setting this to zero should make them compatible.
spidertron-tier-research-cost-factor=Spidertron Tier Research Cost Factor
spidertron-tier-research-cost-addition=Spidertron Tier Research Cost Addition
spidertron-tier-resistance-factor=Each spidertron tier will resist this much RELATIVE TO THE PREVIOUS TIER.  For example, if tier 1 has a 50% resistance and the resistance factor is set to 0.5, tier 2 will be half as vulnerable as tier 1, therfore having 75% resistance.
spidertron-tier-use-factorial-formula=Each spidertron tier increase will be treated as one more increase than the last.  If you think of each tier of spidertron being a higher level than the previous, with this setting off the levels equal the tiers (eg. T2=lv2, T3=lv3, T4=lv4 etc).  With this setting on, the level rises equal to the tier of the previous spider.  For example, going from T1 to T2 raises the level by one, but going from T2 to T3 raises the level by two, making the T3 spider now level 4.  T3 to T5 raises by 3, etc.
spidertron-tier-use-factorial-formula-for-size=Separate flag to enable/disable the same incremental "level up" process as the previous option but for the size of the spidertron.  This setting can very easily result in the spidertron being "too big", resulting in it being uninteractable.
